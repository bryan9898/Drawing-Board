Node-Draw
=========

A multiplayer drawing application with touch support.

Uses: NodeJS, Socket.IO & HTML5 Canvas.

Full credit goes to Martin Angelov for his tutorial on TutorialZine: http://tutorialzine.com/2012/08/nodejs-drawing-game/. I refactored the code and added touch support.

2. Clone the Node-Draw repo.
3. Open client.js and update the URL variable (top of the file) with your computer or servers IP address.
3. Run 'node server.js' on the command line.
4. Connect with multiple clients and have some drawing fun!!! :D :D :D
